## Eth is unlikely to make new lows this time
 
Last night, Fed Chairman Powell reiterated at the Jackson Hole annual meeting of global central banks that "another unusually large upward revision may be appropriate".

All three major indexes spooking U.S. stocks fell more than 3 percent.

The fall in U.S. stocks also brought the virtual currency market.

Last night, the lowest of eth was close to $1,485, and the lowest of btc was close to $20,141. The market panicked again.

When eth rose to $2,000 a few days ago, various groups shouted at $40,000 to see you.

Seeing them so crazy, I silently lightened up a part of my position.

Recently, all the bosses are shouting that "survival is the primary goal", and they have begun to reduce research and development expenses, and the company's unprofitable projects have begun to be cut.

As investors, can we not order goods and keep some cash on hand?

What I admire more is the kind of top iron miner. When eth is three or four thousand dollars, he is mining but not selling. Eth is at one thousand dollars, but he is still mining and not selling. At present, he is still Digging, not selling.

In this wave, I placed an order at $1,400 to see if it could be traded.

I hope that after the transaction, it will rebound immediately, otherwise, the market will be poor and the graphics card transaction volume will be low, and the business will not be able to do.

After all, our core business at the moment is selling graphics cards.

However, whether it can reach 1400 or not, this wave should be unlikely to break through the previous low.

let us wait and see.
